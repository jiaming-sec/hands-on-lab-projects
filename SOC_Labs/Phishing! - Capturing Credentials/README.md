## Overview
This lab demonstrates how attackers use **phishing techniques** to steal user credentials. We will use the **Social Engineering Toolkit (SET)** to create a fake login page and capture credentials.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Attacker Setup
### Steps to Create a Phishing Page

1. **Open the Linux Console** (This represents the attacker's machine).
2. **Start the Social Engineering Toolkit (SET)**:
   ```sh
   sudo setoolkit
   ```
   > If the command fails, wait a few minutes and try again (files might still be installing).

3. **Accept the Terms of Service**: Type `y` and press **Enter**.
4. **Select Social-Engineering Attack**:
   ```
   1) Social-Engineering Attacks
   
5. **Select Website Attack Vectors**:
   ```
   2) Website Attack Vectors

6. **Select Credential Harvester Attack Method**:
   ```
   3) Credential Harvester Attack Method
   ```
7. **Choose Web Templates Method**:
   ```
   1) Web Templates
   ```
8. **Enter the IP address for the POST request** (Default: `172.31.24.5`). Press **Enter**.
9. **Select Google Login Page Template**:
   ```
   2) Google Template
   ```

**At this point, SET is creating a fake Google login page that will capture any credentials entered.**

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Victim Simulation
### Steps to Simulate the Victim
1. **Switch to the Windows Desktop** (simulating the victim‚Äôs machine).
2. **Open Firefox Browser**.
3. **Enter the attacker‚Äôs IP in the address bar**:
   ```
   172.31.24.5
   ```
4. **Observe the Google Login Page** (images may not load in the lab environment).
5. **Enter test credentials**:
   ```
   Email: susieq@company.com
   Password: topsecretpassword
   ```
6. **Click Sign In**.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Lab Analysis - Viewing Captured Credentials
1. **Switch back to the Linux Desktop (attacker‚Äôs machine).**
2. **Check for captured credentials**:
   ```sh
   cat /var/www/html/logs.txt
   ```
3. **Observe how phishing attacks capture user credentials.**

## Key Takeaways üõ°Ô∏è
- **Phishing is a common attack method**: Attackers use fake websites to steal credentials.
- **Be cautious of email links**: Always verify the URL before entering login details.
- **Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: This adds an extra layer of security.
- **Report phishing attempts**: If you receive a suspicious email, report it to your security team.

### How to Defend Against Phishing Attacks
‚úÖ Verify URLs before entering login credentials.  
‚úÖ Be skeptical of urgent or unexpected login requests.  
‚úÖ Never reuse passwords across multiple sites.  
‚úÖ Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).  
‚úÖ Report suspicious emails to your IT security team.

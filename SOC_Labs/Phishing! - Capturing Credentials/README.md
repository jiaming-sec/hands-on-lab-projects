## 1️⃣ Attacker Setup
### Steps to Create a Phishing Page

1. **Open the Linux Console** (This represents the attacker's machine).
2. **Start the Social Engineering Toolkit (SET)**:
   ```sh
   sudo setoolkit
   ```
   > If the command fails, wait a few minutes and try again (files might still be installing).
